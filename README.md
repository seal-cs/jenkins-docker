# jenkins-docker

This is a project for running a Jenkins server within a Docker container on any Ubuntu installation, by building a new Docker image based on the official Jenkins image and extending it by the Docker tools, to allow working with Docker from within the Jenkins Docker image itself.

The project was inspired by Edward Viaene (https://github.com/wardviaene) and his Udemy course "Learn DevOps: CI/CD with Jenkins using Pipelines and Docker".
